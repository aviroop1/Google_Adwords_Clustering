# Google_Adwords_Clustering

<h3> Description </h3>
The Company’s business model is direct-to-consumer marketing.  Over the years they have gained dedicated upscale customers and currently have 500,000 members in their database. They signed up with Google AdSense and created an account with Google. Based on “Partyware” search wording Google AdSense gave a list of nearly 800 keywords and phrases that people normally search, along with the level of competition, the number of local monthly searches, and the approximate cost per click (CPC). The total amount spent per month on the “partyware” keyword was approximately $250,000.  SPW agreed to allocate $20,000 for ad budget the first month, and based on the success or failure the next month’s budget would be decided. Based on the keyword bidding SPW wants to sign-up as many visitors to its website as members and increase its membership base.
